>So, my 6th grade students figured out how to "hack" duolingo by going to a "test out" section, turning their wifi connection off, and typing in any random thing. With wifi off, any answer is accepted. Then they turn back on their wifi to answer the last questions. At which time they gain all the XP points and all the levels are now completely done in gold. I have not found a way around this with them. Even logging out and back in keeps their progress. FRUSTRATING!!!!!
