### **Instructions:**
open console (confused? https://kb.mailster.co/how-can-i-open-the-browsers-console/) paste in the code in the code section. Change the number at the end to what time you want in milliseconds (1000 milliseconds = 1 second), the smallest you can get is 500, this is on quizlets end, and is not an error in the hack. Make sure to **ONLY CHANGE THE 5000 AT THE END OF THE CODE**, and nothing else.
